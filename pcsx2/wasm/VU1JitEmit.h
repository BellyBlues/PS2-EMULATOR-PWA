// VU1 JIT code generation (docs/web-port/VU1-JIT-DESIGN.md sections 4, 5, 7). A block is a straight run of
// instructions from an entry (PC, pipeline signature) to a branch's delay slot, the program end, or the first
// instruction generated code does not run. The timing model decides every stall, write-back and pipe entry at
// compile time; generated code does only the data work. It keeps the registers it uses (VF, ACC, VI0-VI15), the
// pending and committed flags and the pipe entries' flag snapshots in locals, and writes them to the interpreter's
// own state in VURegs at every exit and before calling an op body without native code (which it reloads after), so
// every exit leaves a state the interpreter continues from. The timing fields of the pipes are written at the exit,
// from the model (ApplyExit).
//
// On VU1 a module holds the blocks reachable from its entry block, through branches and fall-throughs whose target
// (PC, signature) no other module holds: one function, whose argument is the block to start at. A block's exit to
// another block of the module does the dispatcher's work itself (its budget test, ApplyExit's and NormalizeRings'
// effects on the timing fields that the next exit does not write again, the next block's base) and branches there
// without leaving generated code. A block whose branch goes back to its own entry with the entry's signature (a
// vertex loop) runs inside a wasm loop and leaves the timing fields to the exit that finally leaves (EmitLoopBack).
